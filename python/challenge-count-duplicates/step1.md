# Count Duplicates

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters. Your task is to implement a Python function `count_duplicates(s: str) -> int` that returns the count of characters in the string that appear more than once.

## Example Usage

```python
>>> count_duplicates('abcde')
0
>>> count_duplicates('aabbcde')
2
>>> count_duplicates('aabBBcde')
2
>>> count_duplicates('indivisibility')
1
```

## TODO

- Completing `count_duplicates.py`

## Requirements

1. The function should take in a single parameter, a string, which consists of lowercase letters only.
2. The function should return an integer value which represents the count of characters in the string that appear more than once.
