# Simple Multiprocessing

In this programming challenge, you will be using Python multiprocessing to calculate the square of each number from 0 to 9 in parallel. Your program should use the `multiprocessing.Pool()` class and the `map()` method to apply the `square()` function to each number in the range.

## Examples

Your program should output the following list of squares: `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`.

## TODO

- Completing `square.py`

## Requirements

- You started with a simple program that demonstrated how multiprocessing works.
- You should have a good understanding of how to use multiprocessing in your own Python programs to achieve greater processing power and efficiency.
