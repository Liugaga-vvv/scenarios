# Implementing the Buyer

In this sub-challenge, you will implement the `Buyer` class. The `Buyer` class should be able to browse the shared catalog and make purchases. Each buyer will run in a separate thread and should be able to purchase products without conflicts.

## TODO

## Requirements

1. Create a `Buyer` class with a unique ID and methods to browse the catalog and make purchases.
2. Implement the `run` method for the `Buyer` class, which will be executed in a separate thread.
3. Ensure proper synchronization when browsing the catalog and making purchases.
