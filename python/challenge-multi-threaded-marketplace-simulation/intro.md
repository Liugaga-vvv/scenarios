# Multi-Threaded Marketplace Simulation

Welcome to the Python Threading Challenge! This challenge will test your understanding and application of Python's threading module. You will work through a series of sub-challenges that will require you to write code to handle multiple threads, synchronize data, and implement thread-safe techniques.

The purpose of this challenge is to create a multi-threaded application that simulates the behavior of an online marketplace. The marketplace will have sellers, buyers, and a shared catalog of products. Your task will be to ensure the proper synchronization and management of data among multiple threads.
