# Implementing the Product

In this sub-challenge, you will implement the `Product` class.
The purpose of this class is to represent a product and access its different attributes through its instances. We can add, delete, or update product instances in a product list through this class.

## Example

```python
#Create an instance called product
product = Product(1, "iphone", 999.99)

#Accessing the properties of a product
Print (product. id) # Output: 1
Print (product. name) # Output: "iPhone"
Print (product. price) # Output: 999.99
```

## TODO

- Complete `Product.py`

## Requirements

- The `Product` class should contains three attributes: id, name, and price.
- This class has a constructor`__ init__` ,It takes three parameters: id, name, and price to initialize the properties of this instance.
