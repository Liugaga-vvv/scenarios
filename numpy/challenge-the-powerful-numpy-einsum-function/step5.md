# Einstein Summation Convention

You are given two tensors `A` and `B` of dimensions `(m x n)` and `(n x p)` respectively. Write a function `einsum_convention(A, B)` that computes the matrix multiplication between the two tensors using Numpy's einsum function and returns the resulting matrix of dimensions `(m x p)`.

## TODO

Write a function `einsum_convention(A, B)` that computes matrix multiplication between two tensors using Numpy's einsum function and returns the resulting matrix.

```python
import numpy as np

def einsum_convention(A: np.ndarray, B: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # TODO: Compute matrix multiplication between two tensors using Numpy's einsum function and return the resulting matrix.
```
