# Trace of a Matrix

You are given a square matrix $A$ of dimensions $(n x n)$. Write a function `trace(A)` that computes the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix, using Numpy's einsum function.

## TODO

Write a function `trace(A)` that computes the trace of a matrix using Numpy's einsum function.

```python
import numpy as np

def trace(A: np.ndarray) -> float:
    # TODO: Compute the trace of a matrix using Numpy's einsum function and return the result.
```
