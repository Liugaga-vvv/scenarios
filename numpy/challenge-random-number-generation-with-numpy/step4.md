# Sampling from a Probability Distribution

In this sub-challenge, you will write a Python program that generates a random sample from a given probability distribution using NumPy. You will use NumPy to generate random numbers and manipulate NumPy arrays to sample from the distribution.

## TODOs

1. Import the NumPy library.
2. Create a NumPy array representing a probability distribution, where each element represents the probability of a specific outcome.
3. Sample from the probability distribution by randomly selecting an element from the array with a probability proportional to its value.
4. Return the index of the selected element.
5. Completing `sample_distribution.py`

## Example Output

Suppose the probability distribution is $[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]$. The output of the program could be any of the following, depending on the randomly selected element:

```csharp
0
1
2
3
```
