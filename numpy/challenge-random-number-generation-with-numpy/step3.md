# Shuffling a Deck of Cards

In this sub-challenge, you will write a Python program that simulates shuffling a deck of cards. You will use NumPy to generate random numbers and manipulate NumPy arrays to simulate shuffling the deck.

## TODOs

1. Import the NumPy library.
2. Create a NumPy array representing a deck of cards, where each card is represented by an integer between 1 and 52, inclusive.
3. Shuffle the deck by randomly reordering the elements of the array using the NumPy `random.permutation` function.
4. Print the shuffled deck.
5. Completing `shuffle_deck.py`

## Example Output

```csharp
[46  6 22  4 13 12 27 28 39 31  5 51 35 43  9 50 24  7 23 38 11 25 52 33
 47 15 45 20  2 40 44 18 14 32 26  1 16 49 36  3 30 34 19 42 21 48 41 37
