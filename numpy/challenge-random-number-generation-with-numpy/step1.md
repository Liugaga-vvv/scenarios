# Rolling Dice

In this sub-challenge, you will write a Python program that simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice. You will use NumPy to generate random numbers and calculate the sum of the two dice rolls.

## TODOs

1. Import the NumPy library.
2. Use the NumPy `random.randint` function to generate two random integers between 1 and 6, inclusive, representing the two dice rolls.
3. Calculate the sum of the two dice rolls.
4. Print the sum.
5. Completing `roll_dice.py`
